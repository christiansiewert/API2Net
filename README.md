This is the .NET API for _API as a Service_.

Hint: Seen in the long term, the .NET version will replace the [PHP version]. It is developed parallel to the PHP version. Please note that this is an early development version and should not be used yet.

With _API as a Service_ you can easily build .NET APIs via a GUI. The administration user interface is an independent application and separated from the rest of the system. 

You can use the API of _API as a Service_ to formally define your data models and then programmatically generate a .NET API from the definitions.

Some important features of _API as a Service_ are:

 * Easily create your data models, including associated field definitions and relationships, while maintaining full control over the underlying database management system
 * Migrate your system quickly and cleanly to a new application state 
 * Create validation constraints to validate input from your API consumers
 * Create API filters and route incoming data for further processing only according to predefined criteria
 * Use modern and industrial security standards and define detailed access rights, authentication and authorization
 * Based on the created API, your consumers can develop web applications, mobile applications, websites, etc.
